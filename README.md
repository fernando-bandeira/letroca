# letroca

This was of my first projects ever built in Python. It emulates a popular game in Brazil called "Letroca", where a list of letters is informed to the user and with those he has to form as many words as possible. There is also at least one word that uses all letters.

Although it uses only the console screen, it actually has pretty much all basic features of Python and even some of the intermediate/advanced ones such as generators. The biggest challenge was make the game cross-platform, since the original version (made in Windows) uses Windows specific modules. Nevertheless, a Linux version was successfully built.
